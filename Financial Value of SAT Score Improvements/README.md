# Financial Value of SAT Score Improvements ðŸ’µ
## Overview
This project explores the relationship between SAT scores and average starting salaries for graduates from top universities. By analyzing this data, we estimate the financial value of improving an SAT score, providing insights into the return on investment (ROI) for SAT preparation courses.

## Key Results
$ Increase per SAT point: $90.01
Estimated salary increase for a 150-point SAT improvement: $13,501.18
This demonstrates a substantial long-term financial benefit from SAT score improvement.

## Methodology
Dataset:

Median SAT scores and average starting salaries for 50 top U.S. universities.
Data was sourced from educational and financial reports.
##Tools Used:

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
Linear regression was used to model the relationship between SAT scores and salaries.
##Analysis:

The slope of the regression line represents the dollar increase in salary per SAT point.
A 150-point improvement (the typical average improvement for Accelerator AI Academy students) was used to calculate the estimated salary gain.
Insights from the Visualization ðŸ“ˆ
The scatter plot shows the correlation between median SAT scores and average starting salaries.
The regression line (red) highlights the positive trend, confirming that higher SAT scores are associated with higher starting salaries.
Data variability reflects different university profiles and fields of study.
## Key Takeaways
SAT preparation offers a high ROI, making it a worthwhile investment for students aiming to maximize future earnings.
A 150-point SAT improvement translates to a significant $13,500 increase in starting salary, based on the analysis.

That being said, Accelerator AI Academy will be far from offering the course for such a ridiculous price. But it is good to get an idea as to what sort of impact the course can have for students!
