# Financial Value of SAT Score Improvements ðŸ’µ

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between SAT scores and average starting salaries for graduates from top universities. By analyzing this data, we estimate the financial value of improving an SAT score, providing insights into the return on investment (ROI) for SAT preparation courses.

## Key Results

### $ Increase per SAT point: Varies by score range

1200 to 1350: $32.06 per point

1300 to 1450: $17.64 per point

1400 to 1550: $256.83 per point

### Estimated salary increase for a 150-point SAT improvement:

1200 to 1350: $4,809.14

1300 to 1450: $2,646.34

1400 to 1550: $38,525.19

This demonstrates a substantial long-term financial benefit from SAT score improvement, especially at higher score ranges.

## Methodology

### Dataset:

Median SAT scores and average starting salaries for 50 top U.S. universities.

Data was sourced from educational and financial reports.

### Tools Used:

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

Gradient Boosting Regression and linear regression were used to model the relationship between SAT scores and salaries.

### Analysis:

The slope of the regression line represents the dollar increase in salary per SAT point.

A 150-point improvement (the typical average improvement for Accelerator AI Academy students) was used to calculate the estimated salary gain.

## Insights from the Visualization ðŸ“ˆ

The scatter plot shows the correlation between median SAT scores and average starting salaries.

The regression line (red) highlights the positive trend, confirming that higher SAT scores are associated with higher starting salaries.

Data variability reflects different university profiles and fields of study.

## Key Takeaways

SAT preparation offers a high ROI, making it a worthwhile investment for students aiming to maximize future earnings.

A 150-point SAT improvement translates to significant increases in starting salary, especially at higher score ranges.

That being said, Accelerator AI Academy will be far from offering the course for such a ridiculous price. But it is good to get an idea as to what sort of impact the course can have for students!

## Gradient Boosting Results

Using Gradient Boosting Regression, we calculated salary estimates for various SAT score ranges:

Example Outputs:

### SAT Range: 1200 to 1350

Estimated salary for SAT score 1200: $68,788.78

Estimated salary for SAT score 1350: $73,598.92

Estimated salary increase for a 150-point improvement: $4,809.14

Estimated dollar value per SAT point: $32.06

### SAT Range: 1300 to 1450

Estimated salary for SAT score 1300: $74,026.65

Estimated salary for SAT score 1450: $76,672.99

Estimated salary increase for a 150-point improvement: $2,646.34

Estimated dollar value per SAT point: $17.64

### SAT Range: 1400 to 1550

Estimated salary for SAT score 1400: $71,259.29

Estimated salary for SAT score 1550: $109,784.48

Estimated salary increase for a 150-point improvement: $38,525.19

Estimated dollar value per SAT point: $256.83

## Interpretation of Results

The value of each SAT point varies significantly depending on the score range.

Higher scores (e.g., 1400 to 1550) show a larger dollar value per point due to increased impact on starting salaries.

These results highlight the compounding benefits of excelling in the SAT for competitive universities.
